COMP 401: Senior Seminar
Project 5
Jinnan Ge


This project produces the simulation of the electrical field between two electrical 
charges (with opposite charges). It produces 6 graphs, using Jacobian method and Gauss-Seidel 
Method. The graph I am showing and printing out is the first one, which is Jacobi method, 
grid 20x20.


This program is a continuation to an interesting topic I learned in Intro Physics, and
used MATLAB to program. It's a visualization of how the electrical field looks like 
between two electrical charges, and the final graph was saved as a svg file in addition
to the fig file.
